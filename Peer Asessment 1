Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1

Assumptions

You have set your working directory to the course project folder.
You did not move the activity.zip file from the folder root.
Calculate and report the mean and median (total number of (steps taken per day))

For filling in the missing NA values I chose “the mean for that 5-minute interval”
Loading and preprocessing the data

1) Load the data (i.e. read.csv())

## Assumption
#       This function will take in a working directory string, file url string,
#       file name and import function type and load up your data file.
#
## Args
#       wd:     working directory
#       lf:     local file
#       fu:     file url
#       fN:     file name
#       it:     import type
#       uf:     unzip file
#       zf:     zip filename
#
## Return
#       data.frame

load.data <- function(wd, lf = T, fu, fn, it = "csv", uf = F, zf, ... ){
        # set working directory
        setwd(wd)

        # check if data folder exists and create it if not
        if(!file.exists("./data")){ dir.create("./data") }

        # create variable to store local file path
        df <- paste0("./data/", fn)

        # download the file
        if(lf == F){ download.file(fu, destfile = df) }

        # unzip the file
        unzip(zf, exdir = "./data")

        # read the data using the indicated import type
        if(it == "csv"){ x <- read.csv(df) }

        # return data.frame
        return(x)
}

## load the course data file
activity <- load.data(
        getwd(),
        lf = T,
        "N/A",
        "activity.csv",
        it = "csv",
        uf = T,
        "activity.zip"
        )
After we load up the data file, we see what our data frame is all about.

names(activity)
## [1] "steps"    "date"     "interval"
str(activity)
## 'data.frame':    17568 obs. of  3 variables:
##  $ steps   : int  NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...
##  $ date    : Factor w/ 61 levels "2012-10-01","2012-10-02",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
##  $ interval: int  0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 ...
head(activity, 10)
##    steps       date interval
## 1     NA 2012-10-01        0
## 2     NA 2012-10-01        5
## 3     NA 2012-10-01       10
## 4     NA 2012-10-01       15
## 5     NA 2012-10-01       20
## 6     NA 2012-10-01       25
## 7     NA 2012-10-01       30
## 8     NA 2012-10-01       35
## 9     NA 2012-10-01       40
## 10    NA 2012-10-01       45
2) Process/transform the data (if necessary) into a format suitable for your analysis

## subset data frame to values without na for later use
without_na <- activity[complete.cases(activity),]
What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

For this part of the assignment, you can ignore the missing values in the dataset.

1) Make a histogram of the (total number of (steps taken each day))

## (total number of (steps taken per day))
total <- aggregate(steps ~ date, without_na, sum)

## add descriptive variable names
names(total)[2] <- "sum_steps"

## check out new data frame
head(total, 5)
##         date sum_steps
## 1 2012-10-02       126
## 2 2012-10-03     11352
## 3 2012-10-04     12116
## 4 2012-10-05     13294
## 5 2012-10-06     15420
## plot histogram, using breaks purely for better visuals.
hist(
        total$sum_steps,
        col = "blue",
        main = "Histogram of the (Total Number of (Steps Taken Each Day))",
        xlab = "(Total Number of (Steps Taken Each Day))",
        breaks = 20
)
plot of chunk totalhistogram

2) Calculate and report the mean and median (total number of (steps taken per day))

## mean
mean(total$sum_steps)
## [1] 10766
## median
median(total$sum_steps)
## [1] 10765
What is the average daily activity pattern?

1) Make a time series plot (i.e. type = “l”) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

## the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days for each 5-minute
## interval
interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, without_na, mean)

## add descriptive variable names
names(interval)[2] <- "mean_steps"

## check out new data frame
head(interval, 5)
##   interval mean_steps
## 1        0    1.71698
## 2        5    0.33962
## 3       10    0.13208
## 4       15    0.15094
## 5       20    0.07547
## format plot margins to accommodate long text labels.
par(mai = c(1.2,1.5,1,1))

## plot time series
plot(
        x = interval$interval,
        y = interval$mean_steps,
        type = "l",
        main = "Time Series Plot of the 5-Minute Interval\n and the Average Number of Steps Taken, Averaged Across All Days",
        xlab = "5-Minute Interval",
        ylab = "Average Number of Steps Taken,\n Averaged Across All Days"
)
plot of chunk timeseriesplot

2) Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

interval[interval$mean_steps==max(interval$mean_steps),]
##     interval mean_steps
## 104      835      206.2
Imputing missing values

1) Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with NAs)

nrow(activity[is.na(activity$steps),])
## [1] 2304
2) Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

I will use the mean for the 5-minute interval to populate NA values for a given internval.

3) Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

## merge original activity data frame with interval data frame
newactivity <- merge(activity, interval, by = 'interval', all.y = F)

## merge NA values with averages rounding up for integers
newactivity$steps[is.na(newactivity$steps)] <- as.integer(
        round(newactivity$mean_steps[is.na(newactivity$steps)]))

## drop and reorder columns to match original activity data frame
## http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4605206/drop-columns-r-data-frame
keeps <- names(activity)
newactivity <- newactivity[keeps]
4) Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day.

## (total number of (steps taken per day))
newtotal <- aggregate(steps ~ date, newactivity, sum)

## add descriptive variable names
names(newtotal)[2] <- "sum_steps"

## check out new data frame
head(newtotal, 5)
##         date sum_steps
## 1 2012-10-01     10762
## 2 2012-10-02       126
## 3 2012-10-03     11352
## 4 2012-10-04     12116
## 5 2012-10-05     13294
## plot histogram, using breaks purely for better visuals.
hist(
        newtotal$sum_steps,
        col = "blue",
        main = "Histogram of the (Total Number of (Steps Taken Each Day))\nPart Deux",
        xlab = "(Total Number of (Steps Taken Each Day)) Part Deux",
        breaks = 20
)
plot of chunk newactivityhistogram

## mean
mean(newtotal$sum_steps)
## [1] 10766
## median
median(newtotal$sum_steps)
## [1] 10762
Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment?

They do differ, but ever so slightly.

mean(total) = 10766.19, while mean(newtotal) = 10765.64. Rounding produces the same value.

median(total) = 10765, while median(newtotal) = 10762. 3 step difference.

What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

This seems to highly depend on how you impute the missing data. Since I used the average for a given interval, there was practically no difference because we basically pulled the averages closer to the inserted average value.

Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

1) Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels - “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

## create new data frame
newnewactivity <- newactivity

## set up logical/test vector
## https://class.coursera.org/repdata-004/forum/thread?thread_id=34#post-472
weekend <- weekdays(as.Date(newnewactivity$date)) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday")

## Fill in weekday column
## https://class.coursera.org/repdata-004/forum/thread?thread_id=34#post-125
newnewactivity$daytype <- "weekday"

## replace "weekday" with "weekend" where day == Sat/Sun
## https://class.coursera.org/repdata-004/forum/thread?thread_id=34#post-472
newnewactivity$daytype[weekend == TRUE] <- "weekend"

## convert new character column to factor
newnewactivity$daytype <- as.factor(newnewactivity$daytype)

## Check out new data frame
str(newnewactivity)
## 'data.frame':    17568 obs. of  4 variables:
##  $ steps   : int  2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...
##  $ date    : Factor w/ 61 levels "2012-10-01","2012-10-02",..: 1 54 28 37 55 46 20 47 38 56 ...
##  $ interval: int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...
##  $ daytype : Factor w/ 2 levels "weekday","weekend": 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 ...
head(newnewactivity, 5)
##   steps       date interval daytype
## 1     2 2012-10-01        0 weekday
## 2     0 2012-11-23        0 weekday
## 3     0 2012-10-28        0 weekend
## 4     0 2012-11-06        0 weekday
## 5     0 2012-11-24        0 weekend
## double check
## https://class.coursera.org/repdata-004/forum/thread?thread_id=34#post-472
weekdays(as.Date(newnewactivity$date[3]))
## [1] "Sunday"
2) Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = “l”) of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).

## the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days for each 5-minute
## interval
newinterval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + daytype, newnewactivity, mean)

## add descriptive variable names
names(newinterval)[3] <- "mean_steps"

## check out new data frame
head(newinterval, 5)
##   interval daytype mean_steps
## 1        0 weekday    2.28889
## 2        5 weekday    0.40000
## 3       10 weekday    0.15556
## 4       15 weekday    0.17778
## 5       20 weekday    0.08889
## plot time series
library(lattice)
xyplot(
        mean_steps ~ interval | daytype,
        newinterval,
        type = "l",
        layout = c(1,2),
        main = "Time Series Plot of the 5-Minute Interval\nand the Average Number of Steps Taken,\nAveraged Across All Weekday Days or Weekend Days",
        xlab = "5-Minute Interval",
        ylab = "Average Number of Steps Taken"
)
